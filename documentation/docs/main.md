Initial v1.0 releasing soon, and the package would be available via npm/cdn.

Meanwhile, you can directly use the [distribution file](https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava/perceptible/blob/master/dist/bundle.js). This project is still beta and would be unstable before initial release.

**Note** : _Use on production is not recommended_ and has only been tested on chrome
